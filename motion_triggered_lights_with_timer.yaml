  name: Motion-triggered Lights with Timer
  description: >
    Automatically turns lights on/off based on motion, light state, timers, and conditions. 
    Requires a motion sensor entity, a light entity (a light group works for multiple lights), a timer 
    entity (with the time set in its configuration), and two input_boolean helpers that you must create - 
    one that controls whether the lights will be turned on automatically when motion is detected 
    (e.g. input_boolean.deck_lights_auto_on_controller) and one to control whether the lights are 
    turned off when the timer ends (e.g. input_boolean.deck_lights_auto_off_controller).
